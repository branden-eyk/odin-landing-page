With regards to the images used on this page, I do not own this content. All credits go to their rightful owners. No copyright infringement is intended. This website exists solely to demonstrate abilities in the creation of a webpage, and nothing else. 

They were all sourced from Wookiepedia and originate from the book "Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy".

According to Wookiepedia, the original authors of these images are as follows:
- "COMPNOR Recruitment", "Expose, Pursue, Destroy", and the "Who's Pulling the Strings" were created by Russell Walks
- The "Join the SAGroup" was created by Marko Manev
- The "Nothing Beats an Academy Education" was created by Steve Thomas

Lastly, the logo for the Galactic Empire at the top of the page was taken from the Wookiepedia page on the Galactic Empire, which is in turn an image originally vector traced by Wookiepedia user Trip from an Watermark on starwars.com. All credits once again go to their rightful owners.
